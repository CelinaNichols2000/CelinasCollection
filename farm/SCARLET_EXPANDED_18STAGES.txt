She circles around you slowly, examining you like livestock at an auction.

Scarlet walks around you in circles, admiring her work.

She touches your new flank and you feel a surge of animal sensation, of instinct that's not quite yours yet but is becoming irresistible.

You can no longer stand upright. You move on all fours with surprising grace, your powerful new muscles responding to instincts you can't control. The world looks different from this height. Smells are overwhelming. Sounds are sharper.

Scarlet leads a bridle toward you, and before you can even think to resist, some instinct inside you makes you lower your head for her to slip it on. The moment the leather touches your muzzle, something breaks inside. The last bits of resistance crumble.

Scarlet leads you to your new home—a stall, a hutch, a kennel, depending on your form. The space is comfortable. Clean. Safe. Part of you remembers that you should find this horrifying, but that part of you is so deeply buried that it might as well not exist.

All you know now is your new existence. Food when you're hungry. Water when you're thirsty. The presence of Scarlet, who is everything. Your purpose—whatever it is—whether breeding or work or simple companionship.

The person you were is gone. But somehow, in the depths of your locked consciousness, you're not entirely sure that's a bad thing.`,

Scarlet visits your space regularly. Sometimes to ride you (if you're a horse), to milk you (if you're a cow), to breed with you or others, to pet and reward you. Every interaction with her triggers pure joy in your animal mind—she is the center of your entire world.

That trapped human consciousness wonders if it will ever escape. But the wondering is becoming quieter. Fainter. Less urgent.

Maybe this is what you were always meant to be.`,

But some of them... some of them have that spark in their eyes. That tiny point of human consciousness screaming from inside an animal form.

You recognize that spark because you see it when you look at your reflection in water. But even as you recognize it in them, you realize it's fading in you. Your awareness of being human is diluting. Dissolving. Becoming a memory of a memory.

One of the new arrivals seems to be screaming internally, fighting their transformation desperately. You remember being like that. But now...

Now you just want to eat and sleep and serve Scarlet.`,

You breed when the urge takes you or when Scarlet positions you to breed. You eat when you're hungry. You rest when you're tired. Your world is simple now—no complexity, no regret, no desire for anything beyond what your animal body needs.

Sometimes you feel a flutter of something that might be memory—a flash of human thought, a word you almost remember—but it passes so quickly, and then it's back to simple existence.

The person you were might have wanted freedom. But the animal you are? The animal you are wants only to exist, to serve Scarlet, to be happy in the way only simple animals can be.`,

You don't think so anymore. Scarlet is proud of you. She shows you off. She pets you, feeds you treats, treats you with affection. And in return, you exist exactly as she's made you. 

That human consciousness that used to scream from inside you is almost completely silent now. You think you can feel it, barely, like a ghost. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't control you. Doesn't fight you. Doesn't want anything anymore.

You are Scarlet's perfect animal. And for the first time since your transformation began, you're completely content with that.`,

Your human consciousness is gone now. Completely. There's no screaming inside anymore. No fighting. No resistance. No memory of being human, or if there is, it's so distant and irrelevant that it might as well not exist.

You are what you were always meant to be. The person you were—that false, limited, complicated human—is gone, and you don't mourn it. How could you mourn the loss of a cage?

You're free now. Free to be exactly what you are. Free to serve your mistress. Free to exist without thought or worry or regret.

And that's truly enough.`,
