                        <p>You want to know about this gorgeous little dress? Oh sweetie, theres a fucking story here. This used to be a cocky hellhound bitch named Beryl who thought she could intimidate ME. Imagine that...some mangy mutt with delusions of grandeur thinking her flames and fangs meant shit against a goddess tier mage like myself.
                            <br><br>
                            I watched with absolute delight as she dropped to all fours, panting and whimpering, her tail tucking between her legs in submission. I purred, running my fingers through her coarse black fur while she trembled and leaked arousal all over the expensive marble floors. "You are going to make such a pretty outfit for me."
                            <br><br>
                            The transformation was fucking exquisite. I took my time with the magic, really savoring every moment as her body began to flatten and stretch. Her bones dissolved into fabric fiber, her flesh becoming soft material, her fur transforming into luxurious velvet like texture. She screamed at first, but those screams quickly became moans of confused pleasure as her nerve endings spread throughout the dress material, making every inch hypersensitive. Her face melted into the bodice, features smoothing out until only the faintest impression remained. 
                            <br><br>
                            It hugs every curve perfectly, the fabric clinging to my tits and ass in ways that make every person I pass do a double take. And the best fucking part? She feels EVERYTHING. My scent soaking into her fibers, my sweat making her damp and clingy, my nipples rubbing against the bodice all day long. When I sit down she gets crushed between my ass cheeks and whatever surface Im on... chair, bed, someones face. Shes literally kissing my ass every moment, forced to experience the weight and heat and pressure while I grind down just to make it more intense for her.
                            <br><br>
                            But the absolute filthiest part is when I fuck... and I fuck A LOT. She feels every guys hands sliding up her skirt to get to my pussy, every cock rubbing against her velvet material before pushing inside me, every load of hot cum splattering across her fabric and soaking through to my skin. Sometimes its on the bodice where they titty fucked me, sometimes on the skirt where they pulled out and painted my thighs white. I dont wash her after every session either...she gets to wear those dried cum stains for days, absorbing that lewd mixture of spunk and my scent until its part of her structure. The guys use her fabric to stroke themselves, getting pre cum all over her before they even touch my actual body, and when Im riding someone she gets bunched and twisted and stretched beyond her limits while they yank her as leverage to pound into me harder.
                            <br><br>
                            Who she was before? A cocky bitch who learned her place~ What she is now? My property, my perfect little dress forever and ever~
                            <br><br>

                        <p>It starts so fucking subtly. My regular shirt feels scratchy against my skin, my jeans too tight and constraining. I tug at the fabric with growing irritation, wanting it OFF, needing to feel air against my... wait, why is there fur sprouting along my arms? Soft white and black patches spreading across my skin, and instead of panic all I feel is… rightness? Like this is how Im supposed to look?

                            My ears are changing, stretching upward and outward, covered in that same spotted fur. They flick and rotate at every sound, so much better than my old boring kitsune ears. When did I get on all fours? It just feels more natural this way, more comfortable with my spine aligned like this. Standing upright seems weird now, uncomfortable, like trying to balance wrong.

                            "I should really put the dr... moooo~" The word comes out unbidden, my tongue thick in my mouth. Huh. Thats strange but not… not bad? Just different. My face is pushing forward into a muzzle, nose broadening and darkening into a wet pink snout. My tits are swelling, growing heavy with milk thats already starting to leak through my shirt. Feels good though. Feels right.

                            Someone walks past and reaches down to pet my head without thinking, and oh FUCK that feels amazing. I lean into the touch, a pleased moo rumbling from my chest, tail swishing happily behind me. Wait, tail? When did I grow a tail? And why are my hands turning into hooves, fingers merging and thickening into useless stumps that cant grip or cast or...

                            But I dont need to grip things, do I? Dont need magic. Just need to eat and be milked and find a bull to breed me because my pussy is SO fucking swollen and hot and empty and... "Mooo… need… moooo…" Words are hard now. Dont need words. Just need cock. Need to be mounted and filled and bred like a good cow should be.

                            My udder hangs heavy between my hind legs, teats dripping constantly, and every movement makes it sway and brush my thighs in ways that feel SO good. My thoughts are getting simpler, just need grass, need milking, need breeding. The dress is somewhere but I cant remember why that matters when being a cow feels this perfect and natural and...

                            The dress. FUCK. The DRESS. I need to... "MOOOOOO!" But I cant reach it with these hooves, cant even remember how to stand upright anymore. Just a dumb breeding cow now, waiting for a bull to mount me and claim me and pump me full of cum until Im pregnant with his calf.

                            If someone pointed this out, if they made me AWARE of what I have become… or fuck, if a bull actually mounts me and I cum on his cock… thats when the horror would hit. When I'd realize just how far I have fallen, how completely I've transformed, trapped in this animal body while my mind screams.

                            But until then? It all feels so fucking normal. So right. Just a happy cow waiting to be bred~ Mooooo~</p>
