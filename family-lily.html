                        Mmm, my darling mother Lily... Always trying to teach me proper magic while I was being a total brat! The amount of times she had to corner me for skipping practice or using spells to peek under skirts... <em>giggles wickedly</em> But she never gave up on her troublemaker daughter.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Such a cuddly mommy too~ Always ready with warm hugs and head pats even after I'd turned someone into her panties "by accident." Taught me everything I know about transformation magic, though I doubt she expected me to become such a... creative practitioner!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>cups breasts thoughtfully</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You know, these tits could really use some maternal support... What a shame I never got to transform her into a nice supportive bra! Would've been so poetic, keeping Mommy close while she helped contain what she gave me~
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your Bratty Daughter,
